Here we have my work for the Module 9 challenge. In the EmployeesSQL folder there is a png file which contains an image file of my ERD.
Then in the solution.sql file we have SQL code for the tables that I made for all the csv files. Lastly in the queries.sql file there is 
the answers for the code of all the required queries that I made.
